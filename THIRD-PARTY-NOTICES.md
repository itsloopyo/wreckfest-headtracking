# Third-Party Notices

WreckfestHeadTracking is MIT licensed, copyright itsloopyo (see `LICENSE`). The
mod's own licence does not cover the components below, so each one that is
shipped or linked has its licence text reproduced here in full and also travels
in the release ZIP as its own file: the vendored loader's beside its binary in
`vendor/ultimate-asi-loader/`, and the ones compiled into
`WreckfestHeadTracking.asi` under `licenses/`. OpenTrack is listed last for
protocol compatibility only - no OpenTrack code is shipped or linked.

## Ultimate ASI Loader

- **Version:** v9.7.4 (commit `6b440669144c4a0bef5718ab155df160d231cd42`)
- **License:** MIT
- **Upstream:** https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader
- **Usage:** Loads `WreckfestHeadTracking.asi` into the game process. The
  vendored `dinput8.dll` is deployed to the game folder as `version.dll`.
- **Bundled:** yes. Vendored at `vendor/ultimate-asi-loader/` and shipped in the
  release ZIP as the install-time source of truth; `install.cmd` never fetches a
  loader from the network.

Copyright (c) 2023 ThirteenAG. Full licence text ships alongside the loader at
`vendor/ultimate-asi-loader/LICENSE`.

That `dinput8.dll` is a static binary and is not one component. The
`Ultimate-ASI-Loader-x64` target in `premake5.lua` at v9.7.4 compiles
`external/injector/minhook/src/**.c`,
`external/injector/utility/FunctionHookMinHook.cpp` and `external/miniz/miniz.c`
alongside the loader's own sources, so redistributing it redistributes MinHook,
injector and miniz as well, and each has its own section in this file.
MemoryModule, d3d8to9 and the minidx9 DirectX headers belong to the 32-bit
target only and are absent from this binary. The MinHook section covers the copy
inside the loader as well as any linked into the mod itself; the licence text is
the same.

---

## injector

- **Version:** commit `3a384e8d1b575c09383b0fab8bd92e34cb654949`, the submodule
  Ultimate ASI Loader v9.7.4 pins at `external/injector/`
- **License:** zlib
- **Upstream:** https://github.com/ThirteenAG/injector
- **Usage:** The loader's `FunctionHookMinHook` wrapper, which the
  `Ultimate-ASI-Loader-x64` target compiles from
  `external/injector/utility/FunctionHookMinHook.cpp`, and the MinHook submodule
  that repository carries. Nothing in this repository calls or links it; it
  ships only inside that binary.
- **Bundled:** yes. Compiled into the shipped `dinput8.dll`.

The binary is unaltered upstream, so the "altered source versions" condition
below does not arise. It is reproduced whole regardless.

## miniz

- **Version:** 3.0.0, as vendored at `external/miniz/` in Ultimate ASI Loader
  v9.7.4
- **License:** MIT
- **Upstream:** https://github.com/richgel999/miniz
- **Usage:** Zip reading for the loader's `LoadVirtualFilesFromZip` path, which
  the `Ultimate-ASI-Loader-x64` target compiles from `external/miniz/miniz.c`.
  Nothing in this repository calls or links it; it ships only inside that
  binary.
- **Bundled:** yes. Compiled into the shipped `dinput8.dll`.

## MinHook

- **Version:** v1.3.4 (upstream tag), vendored as source at `extern/minhook/`.
  The files carry no version marker of their own; the tag was established by
  comparing every vendored file against upstream's tree.
- **License:** BSD-2-Clause
- **Upstream:** https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook
- **Usage:** Installs the trampoline hook on the camera update entry point.
  Compiled into the `.asi`.
- **Bundled:** yes, statically linked into `WreckfestHeadTracking.asi`.
- **Modified:** yes, in one file. `src/hook.c` takes its allocator from
  `GetProcessHeap()` where upstream calls `HeapCreate`, and correspondingly does
  not call `HeapDestroy` on teardown. Every other vendored file is byte for byte
  upstream v1.3.4. The licence permits modification; this note is here so nobody
  reads the vendored tree as a clean upstream copy, and `src/hook.c` carries the
  same note at the top of the file.
