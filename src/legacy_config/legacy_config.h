// player's old file is carried over as that build read it. Never edit anything

// Frozen from src/config.cpp, src/config.h and src/config_sanitize.h at
// d9e4044, which hold v0.1.0's bytes, with three changes: it fills this frozen
// copy of that commit's Config and its defaults instead of the mod's own, it
// writes nothing (the first-run WriteDefaultConfigIfMissing is not part of it),
// and it lives in namespace wf_ht::legacy. It also takes the file's full path
// where LoadConfig took the game folder and appended HeadTracking.ini, and
// reports whether the file opened. The defaults are the literals the code held
// then (cameraunlock-core's PositionSettings limits and smoothing defaults), so
// a later change to core cannot move what an old file means.
