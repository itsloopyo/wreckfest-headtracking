// The head pose is composed into the render camera's world transform just
// before the engine derives this frame's view matrix from it, and left there
// for the rest of the frame - the renderer reads the camera again, well after
// the derivation returns, so an injection that lived only for the duration of
// that call reached the frame's motion vectors and nothing else. The view
// manager's own camera update takes the pose back out at the top of the next
// frame, so the engine never interpolates from a transform the head moved.

// Returns false when the profile's camera transform is not the shape this mod
// composes, or when MinHook could not place either detour. Nothing is left
// patched in either case.
