# ultimate-asi-loader (vendored)

This directory contains a bundled copy of the upstream mod loader. It is the install-time
source of truth: install.cmd extracts directly from here and never reaches out to the network.
Refresh manually with `pixi run update-deps`, then commit.

Do not edit this directory by hand. Run `pixi run update-deps` to refresh, then commit.

install.cmd copies this DLL to the game root as `version.dll`, not under its
upstream name: Wreckfest_x64.exe has no DINPUT8.dll import but does statically
import VERSION.dll, which is not a KnownDLL, so the safe DLL search order
resolves the application directory first and the game loads this copy.
