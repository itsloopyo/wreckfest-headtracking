// LocalSmoothing and RemoteSmoothing must each be finite and within [0,1].
// [0,1] is the whole meaningful domain: CalculateSmoothingFactor maps it onto a
// settle speed between 50 (frame interpolation only) and 0.1 (roughly a five
// second settle), and the core clamps that speed to [0.1, 50] itself, so a
// value outside the range no longer drives the per-frame factor negative. It
// just saturates at one end while the INI goes on advertising a setting the mod
// is not honouring, so the clamp stays: it keeps the stored value and the
// behaviour in agreement, and gives the caller something to log.
//
// This is validation, never a floor. Any value inside [0,1] reaches the
// processor untouched, 0.0 included. `fallback` is the shipped default of the
// key being read, 0.0 for LocalSmoothing and 0.15 for RemoteSmoothing, so a
// malformed RemoteSmoothing lands on the remote default instead of silently
// handing a phone-over-WiFi user the local "no smoothing at all".

// sin/cos of an infinite angle is NaN, so that lands a NaN camera transform in
// the engine every frame: a black screen with nothing in the log to explain it.
// The angle being multiplied is a quaternion decomposition and so never exceeds
// 180 degrees, which this bound keeps finite with room to spare while sitting
// orders of magnitude beyond any usable setting (documented range is 0.1-3.0).

// The modifiers are refused for a second reason: Ctrl and Shift are what the
// chord guard tests, so an action bound to one either never fires (a nav
