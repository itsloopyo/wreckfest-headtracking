# Read the PE fingerprint (TimeDateStamp / SizeOfImage / CheckSum) from an
# Wreckfest_x64.exe on disk and compare it against every build profile in
# src/builds/. First thing to run when a user reports the dormant
# "unknown build" log line, and the first step of a post-patch rederive.
#
# This answers "does this EXE have a profile", and nothing more. It does not
# check whether the pinned camera slot and transform offset still hold on a new
# build - that rederive is a separate job, and the template printed below
# carries the CURRENT profile's numbers, not measurements of this EXE.
