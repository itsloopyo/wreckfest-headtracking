#   WreckfestHeadTracking-v{version}-installer.zip  (GitHub, install.cmd)
#
# The ZIP carries LICENSE, THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md and licenses/ - the mod is MIT
# and the components linked into the .asi need their notices beside the binary.
#
# There is deliberately NO -nexus.zip stage here, and no Nexus page. This mod's
# payload is a proxy DLL (version.dll) plus WreckfestHeadTracking.asi, both
# beside Wreckfest_x64.exe at the game root. A mod manager deploys into one
# fixed subtree under the game folder, so nothing it installs reaches the root,
# and a Nexus archive would install "successfully" while the loader never
# loads. Installer-only is the correct shape - do not helpfully add a Nexus
# stage back. scripts/release-nightly.ps1 passes -NoNexusZip for the same
# reason.
