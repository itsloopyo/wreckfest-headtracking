:: Wreckfest Head Tracking - Install
:: ============================================
:: Thin wrapper - install body lives in cameraunlock-core/scripts/install-body-asi.cmd,
:: staged into the release ZIP's shared/ by Copy-SharedBundle. To change
:: install behaviour edit the body, not this wrapper.
::
:: Source of truth for everything below the CONFIG BLOCK:
:: cameraunlock-core/scripts/templates/install-wrapper-asi.cmd. Copy this
:: file to <mod>/scripts/install.cmd, fill in the CONFIG BLOCK, change nothing
:: else. scripts/conformance.ps1 checks that nothing else changed.
::
:: Ultimate ASI Loader: one DLL renamed to the proxy the game already
:: imports, with the mod shipped as an .asi beside the game exe. Check the
:: exe's import table before choosing ASI_LOADER_NAME - a proxy the game does
:: not import is never loaded and the mod silently does nothing.

set "MOD_SEED_FILES="
:: Left empty so the state file omits framework.version. Nothing here or in core
:: rewrites this line when `pixi run update-deps` bumps vendor/, so a value set

:: Pin delayed expansion off before `%*` is expanded on the `call` below.
:: Under `cmd /V:ON`, or with DelayedExpansion=1 in
:: HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor, cmd.exe eats a `!` out of the
:: expanded line, and a real game path like C:\Games\Oh! My Game reaches the
:: body already mangled. The body pins expansion off at its own outer scope
:: too, but that is one `call` too late to save the argument it was handed.
